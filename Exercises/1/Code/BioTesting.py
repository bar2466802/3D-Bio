    # # The id of the Model object is an integer, which is derived from the position of the model

    # # Crystal structures generally have only one model (with id 0),

    # model = structure[0]  # The Model object stores a list of Chain children.

    # # The id of a Chain object is derived from the chain identifier in the PDB/mmCIF file,
    # # and is a single character (typically a letter).
    # # Each Chain in a Model object has a unique id. As an example,
    # # to get the Chain object with given identifier from a Model object, use:
    # chain = model[pdb['chain']]  # The Chain object stores a list of Residue children.
    #
    # # a Residue object stores a set of Atom children. It also contains a string that specifies the
    # # residue name (e.g. ‚ÄúASN‚Äù) and the segment identifier of the residue
    # hasResidue = chain.has_id(6888)

    #
    #     # The Atom object stores the data associated with an atom, and has no children.
    #     # The id of an atom is its atom name (e.g. ‚ÄúOG‚Äù for the side chain oxygen of a Ser residue).
    #     # An Atom id needs to be unique in a Residue. Again, an exception is made for disordered atoms
    #     # In a PDB file, an atom name consists of 4 chars, typically with leading and trailing spaces.
    #     # Often these spaces can be removed for ease of use
    #     # (e.g. an amino acid C Œ± atom is labeled ‚Äú.CA.‚Äù in a PDB file, where the dots represent spaces)
    #     #
    #     # The atomic data stored includes the atom name, the atomic coordinates
    #     # (including standard deviation if present), the B factor
    #     # (including anisotropic B factors and standard deviation if present),
    #     # the altloc specifier and the full atom name including spaces.
    #     # Less used items like the atom element number or the atomic charge sometimes specified
    #     # in a PDB file are not stored.

# the Superimposer object (note that the rotation is right multiplying!).
